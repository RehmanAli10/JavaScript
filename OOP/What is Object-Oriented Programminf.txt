Object Oriented Programming
----------------------------

What is Object Oriented Programming?(OOP)

--> OOP is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. And paradigm simply means the style of the code, so the how we write and organize code.

--> We use objects to model, so to describe aspects of the real world, like a user or a to-do list item, or even more abstract features like an HTML component or some
kind of data structure.

--> Objects can contain data, which we call properties, and also code, which we call methods. So we can say that by using objects, we pack all the data and the corresponding behavior
all in to one big block. And this makes it super easy to act directly on the data.

--> In OOP objects are self-contained pieces of code or blocks of code, like small applications on their own. And we then use these objects as building blocks of our applications and make 
objects interact with one another. Now these interaction happens through a so called public interface, which we also call API. This interface is basically a bunch of methods that a code outside
of the objects can access and that we use to communicate with the object. 

Example:
const User={
    ---------------->
    user:"Rehman Ali",           Data
    password:123456789,
    ------------------->

------------------->
    login(password){
        // Login logic

    }                           Behaviour

    sendMesage(str){
        // Sending logic
    }
 ------------------------>   
}

--> Why does OOP actually exist?
    --> This paradigm was developed with the goal of organizing code, so to make it more flexible and easier to maintain.So before
    OOP, we might have a bunch of codes scattered across multiple functions, or even in the global scope without any structure. So the idea 
    of OOP was basically to create a solution to the speghatti code.

Classes and Instances(Traditional OOP)
---------------------------------------
--> In OOP, we actually need a way to generate, so to create, new objects from our code. And to do that in traditional OOP, we use somthing called classes. Think of a Class as a blueprint,
which can then be used to create new objects based on the rules described in the class. So it's just like an architecture where the architect develops a blueprint to exactly plan and describe a house.
But the blueprint is really just an abstract plan, like a set of rules, but nothing tangible that you can actually touch. But from that blueprint many real houses can then be built in the real world. And 
with classes it's just the same.   

Example: (Just a representation not actual javascript syntax)
---------
Class
-----

User{
    user
    password
    email

    login(password){
        // login logic
    }

    sendMesage(str){
        // sending logic
    }
}

Instance
--------

new User("Rehman Ali)

{
    user:"Rehman Ali",
    password:123456789,
    email: "vrehmanali@gmail.com

      login(password){
        // login logic
    }

    sendMesage(str){
        // sending logic
    }
}



--> Let's take a look at this fictional User class as an example. And i say fictional because this is not actual javascript syntax because javascript does not actually support real classes. we can see that it kind of describes a user who has a username, a password, and an email. So it's a description of data
about a user, but it's not the data itself yet because Class is really just a plan and a plan doesn't contain the real world data just yet. On the othet hand, we then have the behaviour that is associated with the data. And in this case that's just a login method and a method to send messages. So, this class
has eveything related to a user. So data and behaviour all packed into one nice, self-contained block.

--> Now let's use this Class and actually create a new object from this Class. All objects created through a class are instances of that class. An instance is a real object that we can use in our code, which was created from a class, and a class itself is not an object. So back to the blueprint analogy from earlier, this 
insance is like a real house, which was created from the abstract blueprint created by the achitect.
