JavaScript – Under the Hood
---------------------------------

About This Repository
-----------------------
This repository is a learning-focused JavaScript journey where I document and implement my understanding of how JavaScript works under the hood.

The goal is not just to write JavaScript code, but to deeply understand what actually happens internally — from execution contexts and closures to the event loop and asynchronous behavior.

Along the way, I’ve:

--> Solved conceptual problems

--> Built small projects

--> Implemented real examples of core JavaScript internals

This repo can also serve as a learning resource for others who want to strengthen their JavaScript fundamentals beyond surface-level syntax.

 Purpose
 --------
--> Understand JavaScript internals deeply

--> Learn how JavaScript executes code behind the scenes

--> Apply concepts through practical examples

🧩 Topics Covered
------------------
Some of the core concepts explored in this repository include:

--> Execution Context & Call Stack

--> Global vs Function Execution Context

--> Hoisting

--> Scope & Scope Chain

--> Closures

--> this keyword

--> Event Loop

--> Web APIs

--> Microtask Queue vs Task (Callback) Queue

--> Asynchronous JavaScript

--> Promises

--> DOM Events & Event Listeners

--> Prototypal inheritance

 What You’ll Find Inside
--------------------------
--> Concept-based examples
Small, focused code snippets to demonstrate how JavaScript behaves internally.

--> Problem-solving exercises
Scenarios designed to test and strengthen conceptual understanding.

--> Mini projects
Small projects that apply JavaScript internals in real-world use cases.

Who This Repo Is For
-----------------------
--> JavaScript learners who want to go beyond syntax

--> Developers preparing for interviews

--> Anyone curious about how JavaScript actually works

 Contributions
------------------
This repository reflects my personal learning, but:

--> Suggestions

--> Improvements

--> Discussions are always welcome. Feel free to open issues or pull requests.
