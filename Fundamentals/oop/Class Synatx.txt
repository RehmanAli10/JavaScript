Class syntax overview
----------------------
what is a Class?
--> A blueprint for creating objetcs with pre-defined properties and methods

Syntax
-------
class Student{
    constructor(firstName,lastName){
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;

    }
}

const student1 = new Student("rehman ali","virk") //{firstName:"rehman ali" , lastName:"virk"}

--> The methods to create new objects must be called constructor
--> The Class keywords creates a constant, so you cannot redefine it.

creating objects from classes
----------------------------
--> we use the new keyword e.g let firstStudent = new Student("Talha","Sultan"); so this is how we instantiate objects from a class.

Instance methods
----------------
--> Instance methods are methods that provide functionality that pertains to a single instance of in our case Student.

Class Methods
-------------
--> we use the "static" keyword in front of the method definition. So what this allows us to do is to find methods or
functionality that is pertinent to classes but not necessarily to individual instances of a class.
--> The "static" keyword defines a static method for a class. static methods are called without instantiating their class and 
cannot be called through a class instance. Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application.

"this" keyword
---------------
--> Inside all of instance methods and constructor, the keyword "this" refers to the object created from that class (also known as an instance).

Summary
------
--> Classes are blueprints that when created make objects known as intances.
--> Classes are created with the new keyword.
--> The constructor function is a special function that run when the class is instantiated.
--> Instance methods can be added to classes similar to methods in objects.
--> class methods can be added using the "static" keyword.
